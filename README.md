# CodeFirstDemo
Demo app for SysKit Dev Edu

Start by creating a new .NET Core 2.0 solution
containing a React & Redux Web Project.
Continue by adding Class Library projects: DatabaseEntities, DAL and BL. 
DatabaseEntities will be responsible for handling all the stuff connected
to Entity Framework and database. 
DAL is the only layer with direct access to DB/EF and BL will contain all
of the logic.
CodeFirstDemo handles all the View related stuff using React.
